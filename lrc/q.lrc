[00:09.20]Lyrics byï¼šC. Liu de Almeida/M. Carins/R. Henderson
[00:18.40]I&apos;m leaving home for the Coastline
[00:22.24]Some place under the sun
[00:26.08]I feel my heart for the first time
[00:30.07]&apos;Cause now I&apos;m moving on yeah I&apos;m moving on
[00:33.89]And there&apos;s a place that I&apos;ve dreamed of
[00:37.82]Where I can free my mind
[00:41.79]I hear the sounds of the season
[00:45.00]And lose all sense of time
[00:51.82]I&apos;m moving far away
[00:55.69]To a sunny place
[00:59.64]Where it&apos;s just you and me
[01:03.45]Feels like we&apos;re in a dream
[01:06.36]You know what I
[01:07.53]I&apos;m moving far away

[01:21.90]You know what I mean
